The repository invesatigates a problem of linear regression of building data and how it can optimize buildling performance (energy consumption). In the analysis there are 8 features that are related to different weather parameters and the target is the aggregated meter reading of the building. The report focuses on regression as well as data cleaning, feature selection and hyper parameter tuning. It also takes a look at some advanced neural network techniques and vector machine regression. Finally, the results from the case study are compared followed by a discussion on the models and their different parameters.
